Passionate, determined, hilarious, willful, stubborn, strong, beautiful: these are all words that describe the one and only Anashkusha Beauchamp. Her commitment to constant improvement, her ability to vocalize and conversationalize hard thoughts, and her knack for drawing a laugh are qualities we so appreciate as we continue to push ourselves forward as a group. Full of humor, love and appreciation for the natural world and fellow beings, Kushi is one fierce bundle of love. 

Growing up in the magical sea forests of Marin County, Kushi has always filled her world with environmental education and art. When not working her day job or singing with B-Side, Kushi can be found putting her heart and soul into theater work, hosting Artist Salons in her living room, beautifying funky furniture, or writing in her journal. This coming fall she will be undergoing a residency program with Third Rail theater company as well as teaching kids all about native Pacific Northwest flora and fauna at Columbia Springs in Vancouver, WA. Her raw, pure alto voice will continue to boost our sound on Sunday nights, and engage with the crowds that come to see us perform. She is a driven, wild spirit who adds fire and life to our group and we are so happy to snuggle her and witness those independent flames
