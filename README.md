# B-side Book Club's Hexo Instance

We've migrated the whole site over to use the static site-generator Hexo. Hopefully it'll be more easily maintained by our members!

## Build

* Pull down the repo and install all the packages: `yarn install` or `npm install`
* Start a local dev instance: `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`
* To generate static files run `yarn run generate` or `npm run generate`
